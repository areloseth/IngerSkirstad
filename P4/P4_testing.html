			<h2>4. Tester Audience</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
			<p>Our client has tested the page and is very pleased with the outcome. She also let a few of her friends and family have a go at it, but most of our audience 
			has been other students in the computer lab. The testers were asked to just have a look and click around before they were to fill out the google form. 
=======
			<p>Our main tester where first and foremost our client. She has also been testing the site throughout the developing process, and her feedback has shaped our development. We have also let friends and family try our site. Among them some of Ingers previous customers</p>

			<h2>5. Testing Platforms</h2>
			<p>Most of our users browsed the page using Chrome on either a desktop or a laptop computer.
			Some used Mac. We tested the page ourselves using Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge and spotted no unwanted behaviors.</p>

			<h2>6. Feeback Summary</h2>
			<p><strong>Navigation:</strong>
			Users found it very easy to navigate on the page. We recieved no feedback suggesting the oposite.<br></p>
			<p><strong>Content:</strong>
			Sadly, we were unable to test the order page which has a form that is to be sent to our client when someone places an order.
			Other then that the testers were happy with the look and feel of the galleries.<br></p>
			<p><strong>Design:</strong>
			The testers really liked the images used throughout the page as they felt they really captured the colours and style of ingers products. They also found the page to be really organized.<br></p>

			<h2>7. Our Response</h2>
			<p>Once our client gets a domain name and a host in order, we can test the order page and also add more products to the galleries.
			We could also expand the page with some sort of news blog showcasing new product series and other announcements. We were happy with how organized the page turned
			out to be. Most of the images used were taken by a professional photographer, that probably resulted in better pictures than we could have made ourselves.

			<h2>8. Self-reflection</h2>
			<p>We found it very difficult to stick to the plan. When we planned the project we had only done a couple of assignments beforehand.
			This made it kind of hard to try to assess how much work each design decision wold be and how to implement things. The progress plan we made where each person had tasks with deadlines was completely neglected.
			Througout the course of this project we all learned useful trick on how to simplify certain css tasks and how suprisingly hard some of the seemingly mundane tasks can be. Like alignment with text under pictures that are popping out when you click them, etc...
			Most important lesson. Stuff takes time.
