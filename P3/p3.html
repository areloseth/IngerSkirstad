<h1> The changes we have made </h1>

<p>We had initially planned to have 9 pages, and changed some of the names/purpose/styling of them, 
leading to a total of 10 pages. There were many stylistic and structural changes, and these changes 
are summarized below.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to homepage.html:</strong> For artistic purposes, we decided to make the size of the slideshow images
631px x 479px rather than 400px. For visual reasons, we decided that the homepage will be the only page with a especially 
different footer arrangement. Nan Nan's contact info line is not included, and the other line is taken out of the main
content box. </p>

<p><strong>Changes to about.html:</strong> Instead of about.html, we used about_nann.html. In addition, we added 
the drawing of the long line of people above and below the text and the picture of Nan Nan for aesthetic reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to inspirations.html:</strong> Since we used a Google Map in the  contactUs.html page we decided not to
have the Myanmar map. Instead of having images with a height and width of 200px floated right or left, we used the
myanmarTopBar.js to generate one image at the top of the page depending on the time of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to artwork_paintings.html:</strong>Instead of 30 images per page, we included 
22 pictures upon our client Nan Nan's wish. The background is not white like what was intended, 
because we realized that our current off-yellow background color is more appealing and brings out the
colors in the paintings without tiring the eyes of the user. The background-color of each box in the 
Artwork galleries and the larger info box that opens up when the thumbnails are clicked on do have a 
white backgrounds, however, with the aim of preventing distraction. The small boxes are of size 
238px x 254px and the pictures have a set width of 200px. Although we had intended to include 4 pictures on 
each line with a menu bar on the top, our change in the position of the menu bar allowed for 3 pictures 
to fit into one row. We decided to only have shadows around the box on hover. These shadows are in brown 
rather than gray or black as intended, because we think it visually fits with the artwork.
When the image is clicked, the enlarged version of the picture (400px x 400px) appears in an info box
(570px x 530px). The half transparent overlay covers all of the page, instead of just the gallery 
as we had intended. Clicking on the overlay or clicking on the close icon (another feature newly
added) undoes the enlargement of the picture and hides the info box.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to artwork_design.html:</strong>The changes to this page are identical to
the changes to the artwork_paintings.html page mentioned above, with the exception of the inclusion
of 19 pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to atutu_aboutTheSchool.html:</strong>The logo of the school was not included, because 
we realized that it would be repetitious to have the logo both in the menu bar and this particular html page. Instead
of having two images of 200px x 150px at the top of the page, we instead used the randomImagesTopBar.js
to randomly generate 3 images on load to give more variety while not putting all pictures on the 
page itself. The image bar consisting of three images is 800px x 193.3px. We also decided to add
a photograph of the class schedule for the users' convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to atutu_childrenArtwork.html:</strong>Although we had intended to use the same layout for all the 
artwork pages (artwork_paintings.html, artwork_design.html, and atutu_childrenArtwork.html), we realized that the 
Children's Artwork page should have a more playful look to it. Thus, we tried to make the web page very colorful by including the 
Atutu Art School logo figurines between the artwork and creating a gallery that would be visually appealing. We also decided 
not to have a clickable info box for each picture, because the artwork is already quite easy to see.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to atutu_volunteerAndDonate.html:</strong>Instead of combining the volunteering and donation information, 
we decided to create a separate page for volunteering and donating under the new, main menu tab called "Get Involved." 
We decided to make this change, because we realized we were not fully addressing the needs of potential donors and volunteers, who are one 
of our main target audiences. By creating separate pages, we were also able to make the pages more visually pleasing. In contrast to our 
plan which was to implement just a donation wish list, for example, we decided to implement a picture right next to it in order to help potential donors
get a better understanding of what they could and wanted to donate. We also included a link to the contact us page, so that 
the user did not have to go through any trouble in finding the address of Atutu Art School.  
As for the volunteer form in getInvolved_volunteer.html, our class lecture about forms and jQuery ui allowed us to create a more dynamic form, 
which we thought would be more user-friendly for potential volunteers. We have been working especially hard 
on making this page very simple and easy-to-use, in order to encourage people to join. Furthermore, in both volunteer and donate 
pages, we decided to include some snapshots of the art school, which were dynamically added using javascript. 
We decided to do so to make the webpage more visually appealing and persuade volunteers and donors to help Nan Nan out.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to supportAndContactUs.html:</strong> This page name was changed into <em>contactUs.html</em>, 
because we created a new tab "Get Involved" as described above. 
Since all pages have links to all the other pages through the menu, links for the donation and the volunteer
pages were not included unlike what was intended. Instead of a picture of Nan Nan Art Studio itself, we used
a photograph of the sign of the studio, which allows the users to look for the sign when they get there. The 
picture of the sign is, instead of 200px x 175px, 260px x 195.5px for visual reasons. The Google Map added 
is 450px x 400px instead of 700px to fit in to the structure of the page along with the sign photograph and
the contact information boxes. We decided to add a Javascript function to the contact information boxes to
make the page more interactive, instead of simply giving them in a table or a list. No information is displayed
at first, and the relevant information is shown when one of the buttons is clicked. A secondary click hides 
this information, protecting the page's neat look.</p>


<p><strong>Changes to 1st required JS 'randomImages.js':</strong> Instead of having a random 
image slideshow, used two Javascript files slideshow.js and slideshow_pictures.js to access an
 array of images and change them in order either automatically every 4 seconds or manually upon click 
 on next/previous icons by the user. </p>

<p><strong>Changes to 2nd required JS 'imageSize.js':</strong> We decided not to enlarge
 the images on hover since we felt that if it was added, there would be too many activities going 
 on, leading to users' frustration and difficulty to pay attention. The artwork javascript function
  was originally planned to have a pop-up window. This was changed into an info box as it is a lot 
  more practical and visually appealing. Also, the code includes three javascript files rather than 
  one: <em>artWork.js</em> (containing the actual code used to display the information boxes and images, 
  animate slides etc.,) and <em>artwork_painting_data.js</em> and <em>artwork_design_data.js</em> 
  (containing the array of image elements for both gallery pages. We included a manual slideshow into
  the info box for the user to navigate between the items more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to 1st required JS 'artWorkPrices.js':</strong>We realized that assigning an 
price to each artWork dynamically would just be part of the javascript coding for the artwork gallery pages. 
Thus, we decided to make 1st required JS 'volunteer.js' instead. This allowed us to create a 
more dynamic volunteer form, whose input fields changed with the needs of each user. 'volunteer.js' is included in 
the getInvolved_volunteer.html page.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to 2nd required JS 'rollOverMenu.js':</strong>There were not many major changes that had to be 
made to the roll-over menu, except for that the menu's location was changed to the left instead of the top. Taking the 
guest lecturer's advice into consideration, we did make the menuItems only one solid color instead of putting borders around 
them. We also aimed for simplicity by including one figurine instead of three figurines. As described above, the names of the 
categories were changed from "About," "Inspirations," "Artwork," "Atutu Art School," and "Contact/Support Us" to "About" "Art 
Work," "Atutu Art School," "Get Involved," and "Contact Us." This javascript was included in all pages.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to intended CSS styling:</strong> </p>

			<ul>

				<li>Background: rgb(255,255,204) off yellow </li>
				<li>Links: instead of having links with orange rgb(243, 138, 121), we put icons in the contactUs.html and 
				a blue hover over style for the getInvolved_donate.html page.</li>
				<li>Shadows: rather than gray shadow at on-load, and black shadows when hovered on
				we used brown shadows when mouse was over the thumbnails.</li>
				
			<li>Body width: rather than 960px we used 1050px for visual reasons</li>
			<li>Links: Not just the main title, but also the logo in the banner is a clickable link which
			    brings users to the home page. The menu sections, rather than  having drop-down
			    effects, have a rollover effect. </li>
			<li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar is included in the
			    left side of the page rather than the top of the page. </li>
			<li>Banner: The banner is "Nan Nan Art Studio" written in Kranky rather than Flamenco</li>
			<li>Footer 2: Instead of..., IT2805 Spring 2015, ..., NTNU</li>
            </ul>


<p><strong>Additional Javascript file randomImagesTopBar.js </strong>We also created a javascript file 
that provides four random sets of three images that appear on the "Get Involved" pages and "Atutu Art School" About page.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Javascript file myanmarTopBar.js </strong>We also created a javascript file that chooses 
one of three images to select on the "About" Inspirations page based on the time of day.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Javascript file contactUs.js </strong>We decided to add a Google Map for the 
convenience of the users and potential visitors and volunteers. In addition, we added a slide and hide 
effect to the boxes where contact information is stored. We also made use of Font Awesome icons in this file.</p>


<p><strong>Modularity Requirement:</strong>We used 3 SSI documents; nav.part, mainfooter.part and 
rightfooter.part, and Javascript to fulfill the modularity requirement. nav.part was used for the banner and menu, and the
remaining two .part documents was used to make the code for the footer more modular. The reason why we have two is because 
we wanted to include one within the off-yellow background and one outside of this background.</p>
